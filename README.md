# Pair_Trading_Copulas
This repository features a copula-based trading strategy that models asset pair dependencies using conditional probability. It selects the best copula model (Student-t, Clayton, or Gumbel) based on AIC, BIC, and Log-Likelihood, and uses the Johansen cointegration test for hedge ratio calculation.
